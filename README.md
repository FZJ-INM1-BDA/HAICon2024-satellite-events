üó£Ô∏è Pre-conference satellite events are an excellent way to engage participants and offer diverse learning opportunities. The Helmholtz AI team at Forschungszentrum J√ºlich aims to offer an interactive platform for the Helmholtz AI community to delve deeper into specific topics of applied AI, foster collaboration, and provide hands-on learning experiences. We invite you to propose a specific activity, e.g., a workshop, hackathon, or tutorial that goes beyond the programme of the main conference framework.

The team in J√ºlich will provide appropriate facilities, set up the overall schedule, and will also care about logistics such as transport from D√ºsseldorf to J√ºlich in the morning and back in the evening. Moreover, the team will complete the programme with tours and lab visits on campus.

ü§ù Please post your proposal for a satellite event, relevant for the Helmholtz AI community, as [issues](https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/HAICon2024-satellite-events/issues). You need to have a GitHub account in order to do so.

üìú **Rule 1:** One issue per satellite event proposal

üìú **Rule 2:** Use the satellite event issue template to put your abstract in the right shape - we need information such as a title, description, resonsible persons, timeframe, requirements.
üëç Please vote on ideas/issues that you consider interessting. Join forces if you had a similar idea.
 
üí° Note: Registration for these satellite events will be done with separate indico events. Please contact the LOC team if you need help. The Helmholtz AI outreach team will advertise all satellite events and share information about the registration. 

If you run into any problems with this process, please contact [Susanne Wenzel](mailto:s.wenzel@fz-juelich.de) and/or [Fritz Niesel](mailto:f.niesel@fz-juelich.de).

Looking forward to an inspiring day at Campus J√ºlich
The Helmholtz AI Conference Local Organisation Committee
